## Description:
A sleek and simple portfolio made using React. Showcases my design ability while also showing some projects I've worked on in the past. Messed around with parallax.js as well as a lot of other new technologies that I had never used before.

### Challenges 
- I had some trouble with the formatting with parallax.js - would like to work with it again in the future so that I can fully wrap my head around it.
